## Data

We'll store any datasets we find here.
Each dataset should go in a directory with a short name (e.g. `qm9` or `deep4chem`).

Inside each directory, there should be either one file named `data.[ext]` (e.g. `data.csv`, `data.json`, etc.) or a directory named `data/` which contains the data files.
If the data need to be processed, there should be a file named `raw_data.[ext]` or a directory named `raw_data/` along with a `README.md` file explaining the processing.
Additionally, there should be a citation file (`citation.bib`, `citation.txt`, etc.) which contains information about where the data come from.

See `deep4chem/` for an example.
